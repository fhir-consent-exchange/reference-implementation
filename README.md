Consent Exchange - Payor to Payor data exchange, with implementation guide and reference implementation.  

### Compiling Documentation  

```bash 
# install the sushi tool
git clone https://github.com/FHIR/sushi
npm install -g fsh-sushi
sushi --help

# compile the documentation  
cd output
./_genonce.sh

# open the documentation (assuming Mac + Chrome)
cd output
open -a "Google Chrome" index.html
```


#### Reference Implementation    

```bash
# install meteor  
npm install -g meteor

# clone the node-on-fhir base template
git clone https://github.com/symptomatic/node-on-fhir

# clone the reference implementation repository
git clone https://gitlab.mitre.org/fhir-consent-exchange/reference-implementation    

# copy the reference implementation package into the base template
cp -R fhir-consent-exchange/reference-implementation/consent-exchange node-on-fhir/packages/consent-exchange

# install dependencies
cd node-on-fhir
npm install

# install reference implementation package
meteor add mitre:mehi-consent-engine 

# install data import/export packages (optional)  
meteor add symptomatic:data-importer symptomatic:data-relay 

# run the application
meteor run --settings packages/consent-exchange/configs/settings.mehi.json

# run the application in debugging mode
DEBUG=true TRACE=true meteor run --settings packages/consent-exchange/configs/settings.mehi.json

# open the application in a browser
open -a "Google Chrome" http://localhost:3000 
```

Once running, you can use the data importer functionality to load in the example data from the `data` directory.
